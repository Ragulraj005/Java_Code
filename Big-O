Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior
of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. 
In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to 
how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.

Big O notation is important because it allows us to compare the efficiency of different algorithms.
For example, if we have two algorithms for solving the same problem, and one algorithm has an O(n) run time and the other algorithm 
has an O(n^2) run time, we know that the first algorithm will be more efficient for large input sizes.

Here are some common big O notations:

O(1): Constant time - The algorithm will always take the same amount of time to run, regardless of the input size.
O(log n): Logarithmic time - The algorithm's run time grows logarithmically with the input size. This means that the run time will double for every doubling of the input size.
O(n): Linear time - The algorithm's run time grows linearly with the input size. This means that the run time will double for every doubling of the input size.
O(n^2): Quadratic time - The algorithm's run time grows quadratically with the input size. This means that the run time will quadruple for every doubling of the input size.
O(n!): Exponential time - The algorithm's run time grow
